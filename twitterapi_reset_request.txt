Subject: Request to Reset/Regenerate API Key

Dear TwitterAPI.io Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request assistance with my API key.

**Account Information:**
- User ID: 411806873538985984
- Current API Key: new1_47751911508746daafaf9194b664aaed
- Account Email: [your-email@example.com]

**Issue Description:**
My current API key appears to have access issues from my server environment (IP-related restrictions). Despite having sufficient credits (999,427), I am encountering HTTP 403 errors when making requests from my server.

**Request:**
Could you please help me with one of the following solutions:

1. **Reset/Regenerate a new API Key** - Generate a fresh API key for my account
2. **Whitelist my server IP** - Add IP 43.129.179.224 to your whitelist
3. **Provide alternative access method** - Suggest a way to bypass the IP restriction

**My Use Case:**
I am using the API for legitimate Twitter data monitoring (Elon Musk tweets, market sentiment analysis) for personal trading research. The service was working well initially, but I started encountering 403 errors recently.

**Account Status:**
- Credit Balance: 999,427 credits
- Recent Recharge: $10 - 1,000,000 credits
- Account Status: Active and in good standing

I would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving this issue. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thank you for your support!

Best regards,
RecardoWong

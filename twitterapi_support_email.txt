Subject: API Key Returns 403 Error (Code 1010) - Need Assistance

Dear TwitterAPI.io Support Team,

I am writing to report an issue with my API key that has been preventing me from accessing your services.

**Account Information:**
- User ID: 411806873538985984
- API Key: new1_47751911508746daafaf9194b664aaed
- Account Email: [your-email@example.com]

**Issue Description:**
All API endpoints are returning HTTP 403 Forbidden error with code 1010.

**Error Details:**
- Error Code: 1010
- HTTP Status: 403 Forbidden
- Affected Endpoints: 
  - /twitter/user/last-tweets
  - /twitter/tweets/search
  - /twitter/user/info
- Response: "error code: 1010"

**Account Status (from Dashboard):**
- Credit Balance: 999,427 credits (sufficient)
- Recent Recharge: $10 - 1,000,000 credits (Paid)
- API Calls (24h): 106 calls
- Status: Active

**Steps Taken:**
1. Verified API key is correct and active
2. Confirmed sufficient credit balance
3. Tested multiple endpoints - all return same error
4. Checked that key has not expired

**Request:**
Could you please investigate why I'm receiving Cloudflare error 1010 (IP blocked) despite having an active account with sufficient credits? 

Possible causes:
- Server IP may be blocked by Cloudflare
- Regional restrictions
- Account verification needed

**Expected Resolution:**
Please unblock the IP or provide alternative access method so I can use the API services I've paid for.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
